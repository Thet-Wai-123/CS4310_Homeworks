# Documentation

### Running

-Make sure Python interpreter is installed and added to your PATH.  
-Install required dependencies: `tabulate` and `matplotlib` if not already included by your intrepretor.  
`pip install tabulate`  
`pip install matplotlib`  
-Run `python main.py`

### Notes

-There are 4 jobs text files, and this is because the one with the number prefix are for the part 1 and 2. I have saved those generated test cases for reference to replicate the results. For part 3, I use a random generator that will genereate by overwriting the content each time in job.txt.
